                    <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
                    <p>Fast fashion is a term that has emerged over the last couple of decades and has come to dominate
                        the clothing industry. The phrase refers to a business model where designs move from the runway
                        to the store in the shortest time possible to capitalize on current fashion trends.</p>

                    <h2>Famous Brands</h2>
                    <p>Brands such as Zara, H&amp;M, and Forever 21 are often associated with this approach. These
                        companies typically produce clothing rapidly and in large volumes, selling items at relatively
                        low prices to meet consumers' demands for staying on-trend without spending a fortune. This means
                        that customers can find new styles in stores almost every week, compared to traditional fashion
                        cycles which typically revolve around seasons.</p>

                    <h2>The Hidden Cost</h2>
                    <p>However, there's a hidden cost to fast fashion. This rapid production often involves unsustainable
                        practices, leading to significant environmental and social impacts. The industry's focus on speed
                        and low costs can result in overconsumption, waste, pollution, and often questionable labor
                        conditions in the supply chain. While fast fashion has democratized access to trendy clothing,
                        it's essential for consumers to understand these implications and consider more sustainable
                        practices when it comes to their wardrobe.</p>

                        These establishments sold ready-to-wear clothing, catering mainly to the working class and 
                        those of lower income who couldn't afford custom-tailored garments.</p>

                    <h2>1700-1800s</h2>
                    <p>During the French industrial revolution, factories underwent a significant transition from 
                        handmade processes to machine-based operations. Textiles, including silk, cotton, and wool, 
                        began to be mass-produced at an unprecedented rate. The landscape of cloth production 
                        underwent a dramatic shift in 1829 when the French tailor Barthelemy Thimonnier invented the 
                        first sewing machine. This invention greatly accelerated the scale and speed of clothing 
                        production, enabling factories to produce garments in bulk which introduced ready-made 
                        Clothing.</p>

                        production technique was introduced named Progressive Bundle System (PBS) in which each 
                        worker are responsible for a very specific part of a product, and pass it down once they’re 
                        finished to the next worker to work on their job. This technique allowed factories to catch up with
                        the high demand and supply in large quantities in a short period of time.</p>

                    <p>The 1960s was a decade marked by profound cultural shifts. During this time, fashion evolved 
                        beyond personal style, serving as a powerful medium for protest and self-expression. The 
                        clothes people wore became emblematic, often signaling their affiliations, beliefs, or 
                        participation in social movements. For the youth especially, staying on-trend became vital. 
                        Recognizing this shift, clothing companies quickly adapted, making garments that allowed 
                        young consumers to keep pace with the rapidly changing fashion landscape.</p>

                        parties to provide them cheaper supply cost to compete with their domestic competitor, these 
                        new supply provider are often overseas, with extremely lower labors than the domestic provider,
                        and that explained why fast fashion brand are generally extremely cheap, because their sources
                        are way cheaper than the domestic providers. This is the beginning of what is known as the 
                        supply chain.</p>

                        every two weeks, the industry ensured that young people remained in vogue. The era was
